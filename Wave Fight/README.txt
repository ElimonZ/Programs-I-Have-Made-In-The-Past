This is a game I made  in a week for a small competition in school few years ago. You control the character using WASD amd shoot using Space.
Games idea is to hit the moving boxes before they hit the triangle at the end of the road.
Different color boxes have different health.
You gain the ability to shoot, once you have 20 points in the up-right counter.
